<p>The Node Package Manager (NPM) is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool used to quickly disseminate pre-packaged code.</p>
<p>It has a lot of functionality, but for me, I use it with the command <code>npm init</code> when starting a new project. This command asks the user some questions and generates a package.json file from it.</p>

This shows the <code class="yellow-code">npm</code><code> init</code> command running, asking me some questions. At the point of this screenshot, I am halfway through the process.
<img src="./npm/img/npm_002.png" alt="A screenshot of the npm install command, installing the package nodemon"> <br> 
This shows the <code class="yellow-code">npm</code><code> install nodemon</code> command, which tells NPM to install the package called 'Nodemon'. At this point, the command has already run, so it has returned a status report: NPM tells me the package is update to date (because in this project, I have already installed Nodemon).
