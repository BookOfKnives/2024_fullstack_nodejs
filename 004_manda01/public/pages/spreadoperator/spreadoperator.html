<h2>In JS, the spread operator ("...") can be used to create objects.</h2>
<p>When I started in JS, I had a hard time combining objects. I tried obj a + obj b -- this made no sense to the compiler.</p>
<img src="Clipboard01.png" alt="a screenshot showing how the browser tries to accomodate objA + ObjB">
<p>As you can see, the browser JS returns it as a string (the typeof entry).</p>
<p>To add two objects together, we need to take all the key-values of one object and spread them into another object. For this purpose, we have the spread operator.</p>
