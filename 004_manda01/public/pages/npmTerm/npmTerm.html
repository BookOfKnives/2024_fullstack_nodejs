<h2>How to use npm commands to automatically set the type to module.</h2>
<p>When writing JavaScript, we break the code into smaller chunks -- modules, in this case. JS as of 2024 can use several different types to do this -- one is the ES Module (the "ECMA Script module"). In order for a Node package to allow this, we must set the type of the package to "module". This is set in the "package.json" file. It is possible to do this manually (ie., manually open the package.json file and enter the type), but this is tedious. Instead, I found the command " <code class="yellow-code">npm</code> <code>pkg set type="module"</code>, which accomplishes the same thing from the command line.</p>

<p>I also found the command <code class="yellow-code">npm</code> <code>ls</code>, which lists the packages imported by this current project. Very handy!</p>
