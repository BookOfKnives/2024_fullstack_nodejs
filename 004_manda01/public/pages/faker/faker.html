<h3>Faker is a Node package that can generate fake details.</h3>
<p>This is used to test computer systems using fitting data. For example, suppose you're making a user registration form -- to test it, you have to enter user data, eg., name, password, email etc. Doing this each time you test is tediuos and resource-consuming. So Faker can be used to generate information for these fields automatically.</p>
<div id="fakerNameList-div"><i><p>Fake Name:</p></i><p id="fakerNameList-p"></p></div>
<p>I have set up a Faker API, which this current page calls every time this page is reloaded. So every time you refresh this page, you will be served a new name.</p>
