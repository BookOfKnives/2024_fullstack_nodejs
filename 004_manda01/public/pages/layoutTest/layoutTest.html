            Testtt... centerojsaodfjasodfjasdfo lorem lorem ipusm there are 761 armless and legless corpses floating inconspiciously inside of hanger 96. I say tha they are inconspicious becauase it is their arms and legs wiich demand my attention. I did this, or i could have stopped it. which is it? It doesnt matter now. I did this or i could have stopped it, but nothing in life ever follows a gaussian curve. Sure theyll say it does. theyll tell you that every five minutes someone dies in a car accident, but how often do you find 761 corpses in one hangar?
